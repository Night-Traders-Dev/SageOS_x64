# SageOS Lenovo 300e Build

SageOS is a small x86_64 UEFI operating system bring-up project targeting the **Lenovo 300e Chromebook 2nd Gen AST**.

The kernel boots through UEFI, loads a freestanding kernel, initializes a GOP framebuffer console with graphics acceleration, runs a kernel-resident SageShell with fish-style line editing, discovers platform hardware through ACPI, and provides early diagnostics for keyboard, framebuffer, SMP, ACPI, timer, memory, and battery/EC support.

Recent updates:
- **Phase 8: Persistent USB Boot Log & Framebuffer Flush Fix** ✓:
  - **USB Boot Log**: The UEFI loader now opens `BOOTLOG.TXT` on the ESP at startup and writes a timestamped log of every boot stage. The open EFI file handle is passed through `SageOSBootInfo` to the kernel, which continues appending via a new `bootlog` driver throughout all of `kmain`. Each write is immediately flushed to FAT32 so the data survives a hard reset — the last line in the file tells you exactly where the hardware hung. See [Boot Log Documentation](docs/boot_log.md).
  - **Framebuffer Flush Fix**: Resolved a display-starvation bug where all kernel boot text was written to the back buffer but never copied to the LCD on real hardware. In firmware-input mode the PIT timer is skipped, so `console_periodic_flip()` was never called. Fix: explicit flush after the startup banner in `kmain`, plus a software counter in `timer_poll()` that fires `console_periodic_flip()` at ~10 Hz without needing a timer IRQ.
  - **PCI Scan Optimisation**: `pci_enumerate()` now stops after 8 consecutive empty buses, eliminating multi-second wait-state stalls from phantom buses on the AMD Stoney Ridge IOMMU.
  - **`SageOSBootInfo` Extended**: Added `log_file` and `log_offset` fields; both the bootloader and kernel structs are kept in sync.
- **Phase 7: Programmable Init System** ✓:
  - **SageInit**: Implemented a programmable init system in SageLang (`/etc/init.sage`). See [Init System Documentation](docs/init_system.md).
  - **Early System Boot**: The kernel now hands off execution to the init script for service bring-up and system configuration.
  - **Native Bridge**: Exposed a rich set of kernel native APIs (VFS, console, system info) to the SageLang init process.
  - **Unified Banner**: Moved system banner and MOTD logic from C to the SageLang init script.
- **Phase 6: Advanced Storage & Dual-Image Installer** ✓:
  - **BTRFS Root Support**: Implemented a minimal BTRFS superblock detector and VFS backend for root partition support.
  - **SWAP Support**: Added SWAP partition identification and memory management groundwork.
  - **Dual-Image Build System**: Refactored `lenovo_300e.sh` to generate both a lightweight **Live OS image** (ESP-only) and a full **Installer image** (ESP + BTRFS + SWAP).
  - **GPT Refactoring**: Updated the default installer partition layout: ESP (64MiB), Root (128MiB BTRFS), and SWAP (125MB).
  - **New Installer**: Added a full-featured `install` command and `install.sage` script for bare-metal deployment.
- **Phase 5: Networking Groundwork** ✓:
  - **Network subsystem**: Added a kernel `net` registry for future interfaces, packet-layer structures, and IPv4 checksum helpers
  - **QCA6174A Wi-Fi probe**: Detects the Lenovo 300e Qualcomm `168c:003e` device, reads PCI revision/IRQ/capabilities, and enables MMIO + bus mastering
  - **Firmware staging checks**: Looks for ath10k assets in VFS and reports whether `firmware-6.bin` and `board-2.bin` are present
  - **New diagnostics**: `net` reports stack/interface state and `wifi` reports detailed QCA6174A bring-up status
- **Phase 4: Graphics Acceleration & SageLang Scripting** ✓:
  - **Double Buffering**: 16MB back buffer allocated by UEFI bootloader for flicker-free rendering (supports up to 2560x1600)
  - **Fast Scrolling**: Optimized `memmove` on back buffer followed by targeted `console_flip` updates
  - **Instant Clears**: `memset32` bulk operations for rapid buffer clearing
  - **SageLang Script Execution**: `sage run <path>` command executes `.sgvm bytecode` or `.sage` source files from VFS
  - **Efficient Display Updates**: `console_flip(y_start, y_end)` copies dirty regions only
  - **Performance Boost**: Scrolling is now instantaneous and flicker-free on both QEMU and hardware
- **SageShell & MetalVM**: The kernel shell has been fully ported to SageLang. It runs on the **MetalVM** bytecode interpreter, which features a 32-level call stack, per-function constant pools, and a custom binary loading format (**SGVM**) for efficient execution.
- **Unified Command Dispatch**: SageShell owns prompt, history, and line editing while delegating command execution to the kernel C dispatcher for centralized control.
- **Unified VFS & Shell Integration**: Shell communicates directly with the kernel's C-based VFS layer with support for recursive directory removal (`rm -rf`), directory creation (`mkdir`), and file operations.
- **SGVM Binary Format**: Packed binary format with function metadata, constant pools, and remapped branch offsets enabling complex multi-file SageLang applications on bare metal.
- **Battery & EC**: Stabilized CrOS EC identity checks and `BATT_FLAG` validation with real-time battery percentage display.
- **Line Editing**: Fish-style suggestions, Tab completion, history navigation (16-entry ring buffer), and full Ctrl-combo support (Ctrl-A/E/K/L/U/C).
- **Rich Shell Features**: `btop` resource monitor, `nano` text editor, shell script execution via `sh <path>` / `source <path>`, persistent shell history.
- **Keyboard & Input**: Unified UEFI ConIn, serial, and native i8042 scancode mapping with consistent special-key handling.

## Important Design Note

The current hardware bring-up path intentionally uses a freestanding C/ASM kernel instead of the Sage AOT kernel path. The older Sage AOT path hit backend/runtime issues such as unsupported codegen statements and missing Sage runtime symbols during kernel linking.

However, we are actively migrating high-level logic (like the **SageShell**) to run on top of our bare-metal **MetalVM** interpreter, bridging SageLang to C kernel APIs via a native dispatch table. Once the Sage compiler backend can reliably emit freestanding procedures/imports/runtime-free AOT code, lower-level parts of the kernel can migrate back into Sage modules.

## Code Quality Audit

A comprehensive audit was performed to identify and resolve code quality issues:

### Refactoring (v0.1.73+)
- **VM Modularization**: Decoupled the kernel-resident SageLang VM from environment-specific libc and I/O dependencies by introducing a **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**.
- **Core Abstraction**: Extracted environment-agnostic VM logic (opcodes, stack operations) into a shared core architecture (`vm_core_shared.h`), facilitating shared codebase maintenance between bare-metal kernel and host-based development.

### Issues Fixed

- **Dead Code Removal**: Removed the `attic/` directory containing outdated and unused code files.
- **Duplicate Code Consolidation**: Consolidated duplicate string and memory manipulation functions across the codebase:
  - Replaced custom `vfs_strcpy` and `vfs_strcat` with standardized `sage_strcpy` and `sage_strcat` from `sage_libc_shim`.
  - Removed duplicate `shell_memmove` and `s_memmove` implementations, using the standard `memmove` from `sage_libc_shim`.
  - Added missing `sage_strcat` implementation to ensure complete libc shim coverage.
- **Security**: No buffer overflow vulnerabilities found; all string operations use bounds-checked implementations.
- **Performance**: No significant bottlenecks identified; code is optimized for kernel environment.
- **Build Validation**: All changes compile successfully and maintain functionality.

### Audit Scope

- Kernel core, drivers, filesystem, and shell components
- String handling, memory operations, and path normalization
- UEFI boot process and hardware initialization
- SageLang integration and MetalVM bytecode execution

## Unified Build Tool

Use `lenovo_300e.sh` for all normal operations.

### Build Image

```bash
./lenovo_300e.sh build
```

### Build Kernel Only

```bash
./lenovo_300e.sh build-kernel
```

### Run in QEMU

```bash
./lenovo_300e.sh qemu [live|installer]
```

> **QEMU notes:**
> - Defaults to `live` image.
> - **Headless Mode**: QEMU runs headlessly; interaction is through the serial console.
> - Battery reads `--` — QEMU exposes no real ACPI battery by default.
> - CPU% may read `0%` at an idle shell prompt — expected for a truly idle VM.
> - `Network devices: 0` is expected in the default QEMU profile; the Lenovo 300e QCA6174A Wi-Fi card is only visible on real hardware.
> - **Serial Interaction**: Shell line editing, Ctrl combinations, `btop`, and full-screen `nano` are handled directly over the serial interface.

## Graphics Performance

### Phase 4: Graphics Acceleration (v0.1.2+)

**Double Buffering**: A 16MB back buffer is allocated by the UEFI loader and used for all rendering operations. This eliminates flicker during screen updates and enables efficient partial updates at resolutions up to 2560x1600.

**Fast Scrolling**: Console scrolling now uses optimized `memmove` operations on the back buffer followed by targeted `console_flip` updates, making scrolling instantaneous even on hardware.

**Efficient Clears**: The `console_clear` operation uses `memset32` for rapid bulk buffer operations instead of cell-by-cell writes.

**Dirty Region Updates**: The `console_flip(y_start, y_end)` function copies only the specified scanline range from the back buffer to the hardware framebuffer, minimizing memory traffic.

**Shadow Buffer**: A shadow character/color buffer tracks console content for status bar rendering and efficient selective updates.

**Result**: Smooth, flicker-free console interaction on both QEMU and real hardware with no perceptible lag.

## SageShell Features

SageShell is the default interactive REPL. Its command execution is centralized in the C kernel dispatcher while the interactive line editor runs in SageLang for maintainability.

### Line Editing

```text
Up/Down          history navigation (16-entry ring buffer, newest first)
Left/Right       cursor movement; Right accepts fish-style suggestion at line end
Home/End         jump to start/end of line
Tab              autocomplete commands; show candidates on multiple matches
Backspace        delete character before cursor
Delete           delete character at cursor
Ctrl-A / Ctrl-E  jump to start/end of line
Ctrl-K           delete to end of line
Ctrl-L           clear screen and redraw prompt
Ctrl-U           clear entire line
Ctrl-C           cancel current line and return to prompt
```

History stores up to 16 entries in a ring buffer. Duplicate consecutive commands are suppressed.

### Shell Scripts

Shell scripts are plain text files with one command per line:

```text
# Comments start with #
# Empty lines are skipped

ls /
cat /note.txt
echo "Script finished"
```

Each line is sent through the same command dispatcher as interactive input, so scripts can mix file commands, diagnostics, and `sage` statements.

Execute with: `sh <path>` or `source <path>`

### SageLang Integration

Default target is usually `/dev/sdb`:

```bash
./lenovo_300e.sh flash [live|installer] [/dev/sdX]
```

## Implementation Details & Diagnostics

### Status Bar & Metrics

The top-right status bar displays: `BAT --%  CPU NN%  RAM NN%`

Implementation features:
- **Dirty-cell shadow buffer**: Only changed cells are redrawn
- **Non-blocking refresh**: Runs at 10 Hz from keyboard idle path without interrupt-context framebuffer access
- **CPU% calculation**: 100-tick sliding window (1-second average at 100 Hz) via IRQ0 idle accounting
- **Battery display**: Real-time CrOS EC battery percentage or `--` if EC not confirmed

### Networking Bring-up

The current networking slice is device-first, not user-facing networking yet:

- `net` owns a fixed interface registry and packet-layer scaffolding
- `net selftest` builds sample ARP and DHCP discover frames in-kernel so packet construction can be verified without live Wi-Fi association
- `wifi` probes the Lenovo 300e Qualcomm QCA6174A (`168c:003e`) over PCI
- The driver reads BAR0, IRQ routing, PCI capabilities, and enables memory/bus-master access
- ARP, IPv4, UDP, and DHCP discover frame builders are implemented; ICMP, DNS, and TCP are still pending
- Firmware assets are searched in VFS at:
  - `/ath10k/QCA6174/hw3.0/firmware-6.bin`
  - `/ath10k/QCA6174/hw3.0/board-2.bin`
  - `/fat32/ath10k/QCA6174/hw3.0/firmware-6.bin`
  - `/fat32/ath10k/QCA6174/hw3.0/board-2.bin`
  - `/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw3.0/firmware-6.bin`
  - `/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw3.0/board-2.bin`
  - `/fat32/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw3.0/firmware-6.bin`
  - `/fat32/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw3.0/board-2.bin`

Current limitation: there is no firmware upload, transmit/receive ring setup, scan, authentication, DHCP, or TCP path yet. This milestone establishes the interface model and real hardware probe path for later ath10k-style bring-up.

### Battery & EC Probing

The `battery` command probes CrOS EC via LPC memory-mapped region at candidate bases `0x900`, `0x880`, and `0x800`:

1. Confirms EC identity: Two-byte signature (`'E','C'`) at offset `0x20` (EC_MEMMAP_ID)
2. Validates data with `BATT_FLAG` bit checks: `BATT_PRESENT`, `INVALID_DATA`
3. Reads raw registers: `BATT_CAP` and `BATT_CAP_FULL` to compute percentage

Sample output (hardware with confirmed EC):
```text
EC ID bytes: 'E','C' confirmed
BATT_FLAG: 0xNN  [PRESENT] [VALID] [DISCHARGING]
percentage: 73%
```

If EC is not found at any candidate base, output shows `ID not confirmed` and the status bar displays `--`.

### SMP & CPU Discovery

The `smp` command shows:

```text
RSDP detected
XSDT detected
FADT/FACP detected
DSDT detected
MADT/APIC detected
Battery hints present
Chromebook/ACPI EC hints present
```

S5 (shutdown) and S3 (suspend) sleep packages are parsed from the DSDT at boot and wired to the `shutdown` and `suspend` commands.

### Keyboard

Default builds keep UEFI boot services active so the kernel can read `ConIn` events on the internal keyboard. Set `SAGEOS_EXIT_BOOT_SERVICES=1` when building to test the strict native i8042 path.

`SAGEOS_FIRMWARE_I8042_FALLBACK` defaults to `0` on the Lenovo hardware build. Set it to `1` only for input diagnostics if you explicitly want the hybrid firmware+i8042 path.

Both input backends now correctly deliver arrow keys and other special keys (Home, End, Delete, Page Up/Down) by mapping UEFI scan codes to PS/2-style extended scancodes in a unified dispatch path.

```text
keydebug
```

Use this to inspect raw scancodes. Press `ESC` to leave keydebug mode.

## Current Limitations & Known Issues

### Graphics Acceleration
- ✓ **COMPLETED (Phase 4)**: Double buffering, fast scrolling, and efficient clears
- Status bar now uses optimized dirty-cell rendering with no framebuffer interference from interrupts

### SageLang Script Execution
- ✓ **COMPLETED (Phase 4)**: `sage run <path>` executes .sgvm bytecode and .sage source files
- Scripts can be embedded in RamFS, stored on FAT32, or embedded as binary artifacts

### Battery & EC
The CrOS EC LPC identity check and `BATT_FLAG` validity gate are implemented. EC base address (`0x900`, `0x880`, or `0x800`) depends on BIOS variant. 

If `battery` prints `ID not confirmed` on hardware:
- Verify EC base via `keydebug` mode or targeted port scan
- Or implement fallback paths:
  - Option A: AML interpreter for `_BST` / `_BIF` / `_BIX` ACPI methods
  - Option B: CrOS EC host command `0x10` (EC_CMD_CHARGE_STATE) via LPC host command port

### Suspend / Lid Close Wake
The `suspend` command attempts ACPI S3. S3 sleep package is parsed and PM1a_CNT write is issued, but automatic lid-close/lid-open behavior is not implemented.

To complete:
```text
ACPI SCI routing
GPE status/enable registers
LID device detection
_LID method evaluation or targeted EC query
Chromebook EC event handling
resume path cleanup
```

### Filesystem
A read-only FAT32 root filesystem is mounted from the EFI System Partition and accessible alongside the built-in RamFS.

To expand:
```text
initrd support
VFS extension to additional mount points
file-backed shell commands and modules
```

## Roadmap

### v0.1.2 — **COMPLETED** (Graphics Acceleration & SageLang Scripting)

✓ Phase 4 complete:
```text
✓ Double buffering with 16MB back buffer
✓ Fast scrolling via memmove + console_flip
✓ Instant clears with memset32 optimization
✓ sage run <path> for bytecode/source execution
✓ Optimized status bar rendering
✓ Production-ready graphics performance
```

### v0.1.72 — **CURRENT** (Stability & MetalVM Fixes)

✓ Phase 8 complete:
```text
✓ Persistent USB boot log (BOOTLOG.TXT on ESP — survives hard reset)
✓ Full boot-stage instrumentation from UEFI loader through shell thread
✓ Framebuffer flush fix — boot banner visible on real hardware without PIT IRQ
✓ timer_poll() drives console_periodic_flip() at ~10 Hz in firmware-input mode
✓ PCI scan optimised — stops after 8 empty buses (fixes AMD IOMMU wait stall)
✓ SageOSBootInfo extended with log_file + log_offset fields
✓ bootlog driver: zero-dependency EFI vtable access, MS-ABI safe, flush-on-write
✓ MetalVM scope overflow fix (increased vars/scope and native limits)
✓ VFS Middleware Migration: High-level routing and resolution moved to Pure SageLang
```

### v0.1.73 — Lid Suspend/Wake

```text
- ACPI SCI routing and GPE management
- LID device detection and _LID method evaluation
- Lid close suspend trigger and auto wake
- EC event handling for Chromebook integration
- Resume path cleanup and validation
```

### v0.1.74 — Persistent Storage Expansion

```text
- initrd support for loaded modules
- VFS expansion to additional partitions
- File-backed shell commands
- Modular filesystem driver framework
```

### v0.1.75 — SageLang Evolution (In Progress)

```text
✓ Port core shell logic to SageLang
✓ Implement MetalVM bytecode interpreter in the kernel
✓ Custom binary artifact format (SGVM) with function metadata
✓ Call stack support for non-native Sage functions
✓ Migrate VFS routing logic to SageLang modules
- Stabilize MetalVM heap and constant pool management
- Migrate RamFS logic to SageLang modules
- Implement SageLang-based driver framework
```

### v0.1.76 — Performance & AOT Optimization

```text
- Optimize MetalVM execution (JIT-lite or threaded interpretation)
- Restore Sage AOT path for performance-critical kernel paths
- Dynamic linking of SageLang bytecode "executables" from FAT32
- Sage-native ACPI AML parser extension
```

### Later — System Expansion

```text
- Userspace task execution with protected memory
- IPC and synchronization primitives
- Dynamic module loading and unloading
- Advanced power management and thermal control
- Multi-filesystem support and advanced VFS features
```

## Development Rules

1. Keep `lenovo_300e.sh` as the only normal build/flash entry point.
2. Keep old phase backups in `sageos_build/backups/` only; never in active compile path.
3. Add new kernel features as modules under `sageos_build/kernel/`.
4. Do not reintroduce the Sage AOT kernel path until backend support is stable.
5. Validate in QEMU before flashing to hardware.
6. Validate on the Lenovo 300e after every hardware-facing change.
7. Graphics operations use the back buffer; performance tests should verify `console_flip` behavior.
8. All shell commands must be registered in the kernel C dispatcher for consistency.

## Quick Start

### Build and test in QEMU:
```bash
./lenovo_300e.sh build
./lenovo_300e.sh qemu
```

### Flash to USB and boot on hardware:
```bash
./lenovo_300e.sh flash /dev/sdbX  # Replace sdbX with your USB device
```

### Initial hardware diagnostics:
```text
# Graphics & Performance
clear              # Verify flicker-free clearing
btop               # Check performance (CPU, RAM)

# Platform Discovery
sysinfo
smp
acpi tables
acpi fadt
acpi madt
battery
status

# Filesystem
ls /
cat /note.txt

# Input
input
keydebug
```

### Test SageLang scripting:
```bash
# In the shell, compile a test script on the host and copy to RamFS, then:
sage run /script.sgvm    # Run compiled bytecode
sage run /script.sage    # Run source (interpreted)
```

### Test shell scripting:
```bash
# Create a test script:
write /test.sh "echo test
ls /
status"

# Run it:
sh /test.sh
```

## Performance Validation

### Graphics Acceleration (Phase 4)
- **Scrolling**: Should be instantaneous; no lag or flicker
- **Status bar**: Updates smoothly at 10 Hz without affecting other operations
- **Clear performance**: `clear` command should execute in < 100ms

### QEMU Notes
```text
- Battery reads "--" because QEMU has no real ACPI battery
- CPU% may read "0%" at idle (expected for a truly idle VM)
- Shell line editing, btop, and nano work with ANSI sequences in serial
```
