## Confirmed Target Hardware

- CPU: AMD A4-9120C, 2 cores / 2 threads, 1.6 GHz base, 2.4 GHz max.
- SoC/chipset: AMD SoC platform.
- Battery: integrated Li-Polymer 47 Wh.
- Ethernet: no onboard Ethernet.
- Wi-Fi / Bluetooth: Qualcomm QCA6174A, 802.11ac dual-band 2x2 Wi-Fi plus Bluetooth 5.0, M.2 card.
- Storage: 32 GB eMMC 5.1 on system board.

## CPU Usage

The current early-kernel CPU% path should remain software accounting:

1. Tick at a fixed rate with PIT or HPET/APIC timer.
2. Increment total ticks or loop counters.
3. Increment idle counters only from the idle path.
4. Report `usage = 100 - idle_delta * 100 / total_delta` over a sliding window.

This matches the operating-system accounting model used by Linux-style CPU
statistics, where utilization is derived from time spent in active states versus
idle states. The existing `timer_irq()`, `timer_poll()`, and `timer_idle_poll()`
code is the right first-stage design once native interrupts are enabled.

Next step after firmware-input mode: keep a monotonic timer running even in the
firmware keyboard fallback path, or show CPU as unavailable there instead of
pretending IRQ accounting is live.

## Battery Value

Preferred path on this Chromebook is Chrome EC first, ACPI AML second:

1. Chrome EC LPC memory map at `0x900`.
2. Validate `EC_MEMMAP_ID` before trusting values.
3. Read:
   - `EC_MEMMAP_BATT_CAP` at offset `0x48` for remaining capacity.
   - `EC_MEMMAP_BATT_LFCC` at offset `0x58` for last full charge capacity.
   - `EC_MEMMAP_BATT_FLAG` at offset `0x4c` for charging/discharging/presence.
4. Percent is `remaining * 100 / last_full_charge`, ignoring
   `EC_MEMMAP_BATT_UNKNOWN_VALUE`.

Longer-term, implement Chrome EC host commands:

- `EC_CMD_BATTERY_GET_STATIC` (`0x0600`) for design capacity, voltage,
  manufacturer/model/serial/type, and cycle count.
- `EC_CMD_BATTERY_GET_DYNAMIC` (`0x0601`) for voltage, current, remaining
  capacity, full capacity, flags, and requested charge voltage/current.

ACPI fallback should evaluate `_BIF`/`_BIX` for static capacity and `_BST` for
state, present rate, remaining capacity, and voltage. For normal rechargeable
batteries, percent is remaining capacity divided by last full charge capacity.

## Wi-Fi And Networking

The target Wi-Fi device is Qualcomm QCA6174A. The expected PCI ID for this
family is `168c:003e`. Linux supports it with `ath10k`, and QCA6174 hw3.0 uses
the ath10k firmware API 6 path.

Driver bring-up order for SageOS:

1. PCI enumeration and config-space access.
2. PCI BAR mapping, bus mastering, DMA-safe memory allocation, and MSI/MSI-X or
   INTx interrupt routing.
3. Identify QCA6174A PCI device and load firmware assets from RAMFS or FAT:
   - `ath10k/QCA6174/hw3.0/firmware-6.bin`
   - `ath10k/QCA6174/hw3.0/board-2.bin`
4. Implement the minimal ath10k boot sequence: reset, copy firmware/board data,
   start target, WMI/HTT messaging, receive/transmit rings.
5. Add a small network stack before user-visible networking:
   - Ethernet frame layer
   - ARP
   - IPv4
   - ICMP ping
   - UDP
   - DHCP client
   - DNS
   - TCP later
6. Add Wi-Fi management:
   - scan
   - authentication/association
   - WPA2/WPA3 supplicant support

Pragmatic milestone: implement PCI discovery and report the QCA6174A vendor,
device, BARs, and interrupt first. Do not start with full Wi-Fi association.

## Confirmed Boot Log Values (v0.1.72)

Observed on real Lenovo 300e hardware from `BOOTLOG.TXT`:

```text
GOP framebuffer base:  0xF0000000        (high MMIO, write-combined VRAM)
GOP width:             0x556 = 1366 px
GOP height:            0x300 = 768 px
GOP pixel_format:      1 = PixelBluGreenRedReserved8BitPerColor (BGR)
ACPI RSDP:             0xC74F9014
system_table:          0xC74D4018
boot_services:         0x04FF68A0
Kernel load addr:      0x00100000  (1 MB — matches KERNEL_LOAD_ADDR)
Kernel size:           ~5.1 MB
Backbuffer:            0xC26E6000  (allocated in conventional DRAM below 4 GB)
memory_total:          ~4 GB (0xFF080000)
memory_usable:         ~3.9 GB (0xF617B000)
```

### Key observations

- **Pixel format 1 (BGR)** — the framebuffer layout on this AMD SoC uses blue in
  the lowest byte. `pack_rgb()` in `framebuffer.c` already handles this correctly:
  format 0 → `r | g<<8 | b<<16`; format 1 (else) → `b | g<<8 | r<<16`.
- **Framebuffer at 0xF0000000** — this is a high MMIO address. Writes to it are
  write-combined (WC), so large sequential memcpy operations (console_flip) are
  efficient but non-temporal stores may stall if not cache-line aligned.
- **Boot services complete** — the v0.1.72 boot log shows all kernel init stages
  completing normally through `sched_start`. The earlier apparent "hang" was a
  framebuffer flush starvation: the back buffer was populated but never copied to
  the physical framebuffer until the shell thread's first `timer_poll()` overflow.
  Fixed by adding an explicit `console_periodic_flip()` at the start of
  `shell_main_thread()`.
